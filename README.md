Deep Character-Level  Neural Machine Translation
============
We implement a **Deep Character-Level Neural Machine Translation By Learning Morphology** based on [Theano](https://github.com/Theano/Theano) and [Blocks](https://github.com/mila-udem/blocks). Please intall relative packages according to [Blocks](http://blocks.readthedocs.io/en/latest/setup.html) before testing our program. Note that, please use Python 3 instead of Python 2. There will be some problems with Python 2. 

It is an improved version of DCNMT, we will add more details later.
